        Without it the delay between clicking on the select and showing the list is even 2s on fast browser.
        Anyway there is no need to show all the list, it will be filtered anyway after typing,
        second, after typing only 2 characters the list is already constrained to z dozen or two: so 20 constraint does not limit too much.  -->
